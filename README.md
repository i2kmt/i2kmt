### Turtlemoon

A gal who is really into biochemistry, mathematics and astronomy. I'm basically trying to converge these interests into something creative.

I am currently:
- Studying medicine
- Spying on stars, planets and messier objects with my telescope
- Helping on manufacturing @AcubeSAT
- Swimming long distances
